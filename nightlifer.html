      <h3>Problem Overview</h3>
      <p>After conducting a competitive analysis of hospitality apps, it was revealed that there’s no product on the market which solely focuses on a city’s nightlife and party scene. To find bars or clubs on any of the existing apps without having to face unnecessary results, like restaurants or 0-24 hour shops, and finding trustworthy and up-to-date information about businesses can be frustrating.</p>
      <p>Navigating a city's nightlife can make having fun difficult. This is especially true if you're new to a city or just visiting. The NightLifer app helps users discover new places and find their way around a city's nightlife scene. It includes all the information needed to search for bars, clubs, and events. It even saves your favorite places and allows you to connect with your friends.</p>
