        <p>Navigating a city's nightlife can make having fun difficult. This is especially true if you're new to a city or just visiting. The NightLifer app helps users discover new places and find their way around a city's nightlife scene. It includes all the information needed to search for bars, clubs, and events. It even saves your favorite places and allows you to connect with your friends.</p>

      <div> <!-- Column 2 Paragraph -->
        <p>After conducting a competitive analysis of hospitality apps, it was revealed that there’s no product on the market which solely focuses on a city’s nightlife and party scene. To find bars or clubs on any of the existing apps without having to face unnecessary results, like restaurants or 0-24 hour shops, and finding trustworthy and up-to-date information about businesses can be frustrating.</p>

      </div>
      <div> <!-- Row 2 Paragraph -->
        <p>The primary audience for the product is people who like to go out at night and enjoy a city’s party scene. My approach to understanding the audience was to conduct user interviews and gain insights into a potential user's perspective. I conducted 3 user interviews and created 3 user personas based on my findings as well as a Job To Be Done chart.</p>

      </div>
      <div> <!-- Column 2 Paragraph -->
        <p>By looking at user pain ponts and needs, I was able to come up with a list of features. The list includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Search Bar</li>
          <li>Map view</li>
          <li>Business details: drink/food menu, live updates, reviews</li>
          <li>Search filters</li>
          <li>Like Button</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Given my short time frame, I wasn’t able to work on all the features I intended to include, such as Creating a Bar Tour, User Profile, Add Friends, Lost & Found, Contact Business</p>

      </div>
      <div> <!-- Row 1 Text -->
        <p>As I was working on this project alone, I had to come up with ideas by myself. First, I analyzed the market and the competitors, then made sketches and low-fidelity wireframes based on my initial ideas, which I tested on potential users.</p>
        <p>Sitting down with users and doing a competitive analysis helped me decide on the MVP features. After integrating all the ideas into the mid-fidelity wireframes, I conducted another usability testing to see if the user needs and the design are working together.</p>

      <div> <!-- Row 2 Text -->
        <p>While building the product’s concept, I started establishing the brand including the color palette, typography, icons, and logo.</p>
        <p>I wanted to create a brand, which has the vibe of the 80’s, but remains modern. To achieve that, I chose a dark purple palette with neon pop-up colors in it, and the Montserrat font.</p>

        <h2>User Flow</h2>
      </div>
      <div> <!-- Row 1 Text -->
        <p>Since the product’s main feature is to find a bar/club and land on their profile in the fastest possible way, I created one large user flow, that shows how to access a business profile in different ways.</p>

        <p>The final product helps users find and like places efficiently, access detailed information about a business, open the map to navigate easier, leave and read reviews. Additionally, users can create Bar Tours with other users to plan their night out easily.</p>

        <p>NightLifer was a project close to me, since I like to go out and had many problems finding new places or navigating in a new city. If I had additional time and capacity, I would have loved to design the remaining features and test the product more time to fully validate the product.</p>
        <p>This app was a massive project that I would love to do again with a team in the future. I believe this product could be a viable app, but It needs further refinement and more background research.</p>
